##### The dataset downloaded from Kaggle contained over 17,000 rows and ... columns. When going through the dataset in Excel, I performed the following:
- ##### Adjust id column series to be in order
- ##### Replace 'Unknown' and blank cells with 'NULL' for text columns
- ##### Replace blank cells with 0 for numeric columns
- ##### Identify cells with lists seperated by commas and create individual columns for each value
- ##### Change the dates to be the same format
- ##### Change column labels to include underscores in preperation for SQL import

##### Note: Some tables may be too large to view in Github. To view, download the file and open on your desktop.
